            Eager loading or lazy loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming which
            will initialize an object upon creation or load on-demand. In carbon, lazy loading is used to
            load tenant when a request is received only. Similarly Eager loading is used to enable load
            existing tenants after carbon server starts up. Using this feature, you will be able to include
            or exclude tenants which are to be loaded when server startup.

            We can enable only one LoadingPolicy at a given time.

            1. Tenant Lazy Loading
               This is the default behaviour and enabled by default. With this policy, tenants are not loaded at
               server startup, but loaded based on-demand (i.e when a request is received for a tenant).
               The default tenant idle time is 30 minutes.

            2. Tenant Eager Loading
               This is by default not enabled. It can be be enabled by un-commenting the <EagerLoading> section.
               The eager loading configurations supported are as below. These configurations can be given as the
               value for <Include> element with eager loading.
                    (i)Load all tenants when server startup             -   *
                    (ii)Load all tenants except foo.com & bar.com       -   *,!foo.com,!bar.com
                    (iii)Load only foo.com &  bar.com to be included    -   foo.com,bar.com

                 In which role is stored at user level. Depending on this value we need to change the Search Base within code.
                 isADLDSRole - (Do not comment) Set to true if connecting to an AD LDS instance else set to false.

    ************* Description of some of the configuration properties used in user-mgt.xml *********************************

    DomainName -
        This property must be used by all secondary user store managers in multiple user store configuration.
        DomainName is a unique identifier given to the user store. Users must provide both the domain name and
        username at log-in as "DomainName\Username"

    UserRolesCacheEnabled -
        This is to indicate whether to cache role list of a user. By default it is set to true.
        You may need to disable it if user-roles are changed by external means and need to reflect
        those changes in the carbon product immediately.

    ReplaceEscapeCharactersAtUserLogin -
        This is to configure whether escape characters in user name needs to be replaced at user login.
        Currently the identified escape characters that needs to be replaced are '\' & '\\'

    UserDNPattern -
        This property will be used when authenticating users. During authentication we do a bind. But if the user is login
        with email address or some other property we need to first lookup LDAP and retrieve DN for the user.
        This involves an additional step.  If UserDNPattern is specified the DN will be constructed using the pattern
        specified in this property. Performance of this is much better than looking up DN and binding user.

    RoleDNPattern -
        This property will be used when checking whether user has been assigned to a given role.
        Rather than searching the role in search base, by using this property direct search can be done.

    PasswordHashMethod -
        This says how the password should be stored. Allowed values are as follows,
            SHA - Uses SHA digest method
            MD5 - Uses MD 5 digest method
            PLAIN_TEXT - Plain text passwords
            In addition to above this supports all digest methods supported by http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html.

    DisplayNameAttribute -
        This is to have a dedicated LDAP attribute to display an entity(User/Role) in UI, in addition to the UserNameAttribute which is used for IS-UserStore interactions.
